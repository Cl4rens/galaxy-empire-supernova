# Game rules

The original server's numbers are lost. Galaxy Empire is closely modelled on OGame (same
buildings, ships, research, resources), so Supernova uses the classic OGame formulas as a
starting point. They live in [`server/supernova/economy.py`](../server/supernova/economy.py).
Corrections from people who remember the original values are very welcome.

All production and build times scale with the server's game speed (`SUPERNOVA_SPEED`,
default 1).

## New account

- 500 metal, 500 crystal, 0 deuterium
- all buildings at level 0; storage for 10,000 of each resource
- base production without any mine: 30 metal and 15 crystal per hour

## Buildings

Cost to upgrade from level *L* to *L+1*: `base × factor^L`.

\* No OGame equivalent; values are made up. Moon buildings (17–19) are not implemented yet.

- **Build time** (hours) = (metal + crystal) / (2500 × (1 + robotics level) × 2^nanite level) / speed,
  at least 1 second.
- **Tear down** costs half of what the current level cost to build.
- **One construction at a time** per planet. Cancelling refunds the full cost.
- **Lots:** the three mines have fixed lots 1–3; every other building takes one of the free
  lots 4–15 when it is first built and frees it when torn down to level 0.

## Production per hour

| | Formula |
|-|---------|
| Metal Mine | 30 × L × 1.1^L |
| Crystal Mine | 20 × L × 1.1^L |
| Deuterium Synthesizer | 10 × L × 1.1^L |
| Solar Plant (energy) | 20 × L × 1.1^L |
| Fusion Reactor (energy) | 30 × L × (1.05 + 0.01 × Energy Technology)^L, uses 10 × L × 1.1^L deuterium |

Mines use energy (metal and crystal 10 × L × 1.1^L, deuterium 20 × L × 1.1^L). If they need more
energy than the planet produces, all mines produce proportionally less. Every mine and power
plant can be throttled with its percentage setting.

**Storage capacity** = 5000 × ⌊2.5 × e^(20 × L / 33)⌋. Mines stop producing when the storage is
full.
